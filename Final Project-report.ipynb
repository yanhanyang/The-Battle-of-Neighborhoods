The investor should open this lunch bar where it is closest to its customers in order to be easy accessed. which neighborhood (in that borough) would be a better choice for the investor to open the lunch bar in that neighborhood?\n\nOur mission is to find the most suitable neighborhood.",

These dataset provides the information of postal codes, boroughs and neighborhoods of Toronto.\n* Coordinates data from geopy library in Python, which provide the longitude and latitude according to the \u201caddress\u201d(Tonronto)\n* Foursquare API geocode data, which contains most common venues according to the neighborhood.\n\n( A typical request from Foursquare will provide us with the following information:\n[Postal Code] [Neighborhood(s)] [Neighborhood Latitude] [Neighborhood Longitude] [Venue] [Venue Summary] [Venue Category] [Distance (meter)]\n[M1L] [Clairlea, Golden Mile, Oakridge] [43.711112] [-79.284577] [Tim Hortons] [This spot is popular] [Coffee Shop] [592]\u00b6)\n",

We will essentially obtain our information from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M and then process the table inside this site.\n\n__Second__: Connecting to Foursquare and Retrieving Locational Data for Each Venue in Every Neighborhood.\nAfter finding the list of neighborhoods, we then connect to the Foursquare API to gather information about venues inside each and every neighborhood. For each neighborhood, we have chosen the radius to be 1000 meter.\n\n__Third__:Processing the Retrieved Data and Creating a DataFrome for All the Venues inside the Area of North York.\nWhen the data is completely gathered, we will perform processing on that raw data to find our desirable features for each venue. Our main feature is the category of that venue. After this stage, the column \"Venue's Category\" wil be hotspot of that area and different venues will have different feature-columns. After that we will integrate all shop columns to one column \"Total Shops\" and all Stores columns to \"Total Stores\" column. We assumed that different stores and shops have same custome volume.the dataset is fully ready to be used for machine learning (and statistical analysis) purposes.\n\n__Final__: Applying one of Machine Learning Techniques (K-Means Clustering) Here we cluster neighborhoods via K-means clustering method. We think that 5 clusters is enough and can cover the complexity of our problem. After clustering we will update our dataset and create a column representing the group for each neighborhood.",
